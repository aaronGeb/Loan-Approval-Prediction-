# Loan Approval Prediction
This project is focused on predicting whether a loan application will be approved or not based on a set of features using machine learning techniques. It aims to provide insights into the key factors affecting loan approval and to develop a robust predictive model.
# Overview
The Loan Approval Prediction Project helps financial institutions determine whether a loan should be approved or rejected based on historical data. This can save time, minimize risks, and optimize decision-making processes. The project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.
# Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains records of loan applicants with various attributes like income, education, credit history, etc. Each record is labeled as approved or not approved.
Source: [Mention the source of your dataset, e.g., Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, or synthetic.]

# Project Workflow

**1.	Data Preprocessing**

- Handling missing values.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Scaling numerical variables.

**2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Distribution analysis.
- Correlation analysis.

**3.	Feature Engineering**
- Eliminating irrelevant features.
  
**4.	Model Training and Evaluation**
- Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost.
- Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC
  
**5.	Deployment**
- Building a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions using Flask.
  
# installation
**1.Clone this repository:**
```
git clone https://github.com/aaronGeb/loan-approval-prediction.git
cd loan-approval-prediction
```
**2.	Build the Docker Image:**

Use the following command to build the Docker image
```
docker build -t loan-approval-prediction .
```
**3.Run the Docker Container**
